## CodePath Week 4: Twitter Contd.

This is the assignment for Week 4 of the [CodePath](http://www.codepath.com) iOS for Engineers class for Fall 2015, built with [Xcode 7.0](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/) and [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/). 

It builds on top of Week 3's [basic Twitter client](https://github.com/xke/Twitter) to add sidebar menu functionality utilizing gesture recognition, and a profile page linked from the menu and from images in the main timeline.

The real Twitter app has thousands of other features, which we won't be delving into here. Also, more features does not necessarily make a product better, or easier to use. At times, it's the opposite. The difficult trick is to build features that yield the most impact for users, within an environment of non-infinite time and resources!

Time spent: 10 hours
